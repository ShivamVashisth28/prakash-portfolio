<div class="about-me-text"> <span class="about-me-span"> Welcome to my story:) </span> 
    <br> 
    <br>
    After pursuing a super stressful career path in business development for far too long, finally, five months ago, I
    decided to make a U-turn and come up with an escape plan.
    <br>
    <br>
    The plan focused on combining my education in industrial product design, experience in b2b customer relations, and
    hobbies for books and languages into a new career path that I would enjoy and have the opportunity to grow in - most
    importantly, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, that I'm the master of my destiny. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, I'm working towards becoming a junior front-end developer. In an ever-expanding digital environment, my
    goal is to build websites that are profitable for businesses and satisfying for their customers.
